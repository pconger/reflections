Q:
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A:
A git directory is created.
I need to do it to be able to commit my files.

Q:
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A:
The staging area has files that will be committed,
whereas the working directory has all the files I'm working on,
and the repository has all the file versions that have been committed.

Q:
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
A:
I can run the git diff --staged command to compare the files in my staging area to the most recent commit.
