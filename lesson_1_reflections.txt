How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It limited the amount of information I had to sort.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can compare previous versions of my work, be less likely to lose something.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I can create a logic behind the versions I save.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    This feature helps save related files together.
    When a change is made in one file,
    we might want to save all the files together after the change
    since the change in the one file will affect the others.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows me the different commits.
    git diff shows me the difference between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I feel better about experimenting.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to make awesome webpages with Git.
